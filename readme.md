## Background

I created this as a little brain teezer for the elite101 program I had to finish a project of my choosing. I decided to go with the autocorrector as it seemed the most fun out of the three options.

## Install

Only thing required is Python from Repl.it 

## Usage

Run the program and enter in a word, if the word exist in the word bank it'll say its a real word. However, if not a real word it'll try and correcct user input to become a real word. If the word still does not exist in the bank it'll return that user input is not a real word.
